          <h2>Automated Piano Tiles Game</h2>
          <p class="description">My inspiration for this project was brought about thanks to some random post I saw on a
            game forum. The poster noted that the game was incredibly difficult, so curiosity got the best of me. Just 
            as the poster promised, this game was difficult level insane on computer, so I went to work with technology.
            This was the first time I had done anything with image capture, so it was a fun project to say the least.

          <h2>Tennis Pro Comparison App</h2>
          <p class="description">I'm a big fan of the sport of tennis (if you are in the KC metro and want to hit the 
            court, drop me a line) and with Novak Djokovic tying Rafael Nadal for Grand Slam Titles (at the time of this 
            writing) it seems natural to ask "who is the GOAT?". So I built a tool to let people draw their own 
            conclusions about who that may be as well as compare other pros.
