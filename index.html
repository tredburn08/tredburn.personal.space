      <h1 id="heading">Hi there! I'm Trace Redburn.</h1>
  
      <p>Thank you for stopping by my personal website! My name is Trace Redburn and I am expanding my skills as a
          software developer. I chose an iceberg as the background for this page as I find it does a great job of
          signifying how we view other people at a quick glance. On this page, you will see little tidbits of who
          I am, but there is far more to me than what is seen on the surface. As you navigate this site, you will
          learn more about me and what I am up to. Prospective employers, please check out my 
          <strong>resume</strong> and <strong>project archives</strong>. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
          
      <h2>Current Goals</h2>
      <p>For the past year, I have been improving my web development skills. Coming from a purely backend dev 
          background, it has been quite learning experience. The languages are much more free form and mastering visual 
          design has been a big challenge, however I'm fully embracing that challenge and I'm excited about it. I have a
          lot to learn still, but my immediate focus is mastering javascript and learning react by the end of 2023.
      </p>

      <h2>In the Works</h2>
      <p>During my life thus far, I've learned a ton of things in only the past few years that I wish I would've known 
          when I was younger. These life hacks, had I known of them 10 years ago, would've skyrocketed my relationships
          and career. I have found personal success with these ideas and I want to share them with others so they can
          avoid the same mistakes I made trying to figure it out the hard way. This project is to start speaking 
          engagements that target high school juniors and seniors, college students, and young professionals. Topics I 
          would like to cover are things such as post-secondary education paths, career development, networking, and 
          setting yourself up for financial success while you are still young.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I find it important to make time for some fun outside of work. I love spending time with my family and
          exploring the outdoors with my two crazy dogs. I enjoy fitness activities, especially tennis. I haven't 
          competed in any official tournaments since my high school days, but I am hopeful to participate in a few
          USTA tournaments this year. I am always looking for new players to hit with, so if you are in the
          southern part of the KC metro, let's hit the courts!
